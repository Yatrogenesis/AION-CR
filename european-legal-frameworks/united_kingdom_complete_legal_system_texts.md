### COMMON LAW SYSTEM - JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS

#### LANDMARK CASES - COMPLETE CITATIONS

**Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562**
**Lord Atkin's Neighbour Principle**: "You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question."

**R v R [1991] UKHL 12**
**Marital Rape Decision**: "The common law is capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments. The idea that a wife by marriage consents in advance to her husband having sexual intercourse with her whatever her state of health or however proper her objections, is no longer acceptable."

**A v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56**
**Belmarsh Case**: "The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these."
