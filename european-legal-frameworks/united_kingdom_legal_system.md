## Constitutional Framework

### Unwritten Constitution

The United Kingdom operates under an **unwritten constitution** composed of multiple sources rather than a single constitutional document. This provides exceptional flexibility for constitutional evolution through ordinary legislative processes and conventional development.

#### Constitutional Sources

**1. Magna Carta 1215**
- **Legal Authority**: Foundational constitutional authority
- **Content Area**: Due process, rule of law
- **Binding Force**: Symbolic and interpretive authority
- **Key Provision (Article 39)**: "No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."

**2. Bill of Rights 1689**
- **Legal Authority**: Parliamentary supremacy establishment
- **Content Area**: Parliamentary privilege, royal prerogative limits
- **Key Provision**: "That the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal."

**3. Act of Union 1707**
- **Legal Authority**: Union foundation
- **Content Area**: Scottish-English union, parliamentary union
- **Constitutional Significance**: Created unified Parliament of Great Britain

**4. Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949**
- **Legal Authority**: House of Lords limitation
- **Content Area**: Bicameral relations, legislative supremacy
- **Effect**: Limited House of Lords' power to delay legislation

### Historical Documents Impact

#### Bill of Rights Continuing Effect
- **Parliamentary Privilege**: Article 9 protection remains active for parliamentary proceedings
- **Executive Limitations**: Royal prerogative subject to parliamentary control
- **Modern Application**: Fundamental to parliamentary procedure and ministerial accountability

### Constitutional Conventions

## Parliamentary Sovereignty

### Core Principle
**Definition**: Parliament has the right to make or unmake any law whatever; and further, that no person or body is recognised by the law as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.

- **Unlimited Legislative Authority**: No legal limits on parliamentary law-making
- **No Rival Law-Making Body**: Parliament is supreme legislative authority
- **No Person Above Parliament**: No individual or institution can override Parliament

### Modern Qualifications

## Common Law System

### Fundamental Principles

#### Precedent System (Stare Decisis)

- **Factual Distinguishing**: Material differences in facts
- **Legal Distinguishing**: Different legal context or principle
- **Narrow Interpretation**: Restrictive reading of previous decision

**Overruling Mechanisms**:
- **Higher Court Overruling**: Higher court declares previous decision wrong
- **Same Court Overruling**: Limited circumstances for Court of Appeal and Supreme Court
- **Parliamentary Overruling**: Legislation reversing judicial decisions

### Equity System

**Equitable Remedies**:

### Statutory Interpretation

#### Interpretation Approaches
**1. Literal Rule**: Words given ordinary grammatical meaning
**2. Golden Rule**: Literal meaning unless leads to absurdity
**3. Mischief Rule**: Interpretation to remedy mischief Parliament intended to address
**4. Purposive Approach**: Interpretation to achieve legislative purpose

#### Human Rights Impact
**Section 3 HRA 1998**: "So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights."
